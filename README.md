# SimpleShooter
 With the online course that GameDev.tv offers, I developed a simple third-person shooter game in Unreal Engine 5 using C++. Player must clear all the opponents in the facility by shooting them to win. I have also made additional improvements beyond what was taught in the course. These include enhancements to the artificial intelligence system, improvements in player movement, and the addition of extra animations corresponding to these new player movements. Some assets used may contain copyright. While some assets are available in epic games store, some assets are given from the course. So please do not distribute items inside the project. This project is here for portfolio purposes.
